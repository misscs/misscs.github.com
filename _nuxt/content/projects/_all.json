    "body": "<p>Radio has been my love since college. I was super pumped to get to co-host this set with my dear friend Mikah Sykes. I owe my love of jazz to hime.</p>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>I was honored to have a special guest host all the way from Harlem in New York!  None other than Claudina Sarahe Gorashi (she’s pictured in the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sweatshirt on this page); she’s a personal friend of actual living and breathing current members of Sun Ra’s Arkestra (name dropping - sorry) and a very special girl with impeccable taste in jazz and music in general.  She took me to see the Sugar Hill Quartet at the legendary Lennox Lounge in Harlem last time I visited, and together we scoured the record shops all over Western Europe - a little international crate digging - expanding our already massive jazz LP collections, shipping our bounty back to the US in between stops.  The set I played was primarily picked by her - and as you can tell, she knows whats up!</p>\n"

Student teams could go over and film or ask questions during the day. Everything was within walking distance.</p>\n"

The Good Harvest Food Coop (D.B.A. 4th Street Food Coop) was created sometime thereafter.\nIt's not completely clear how to me how the two are related. I've been told that GFC closed a couple of years before GHFC started, making it not so much a \"phoenix from the ashes\" as a \"tree grown from a seed that survived the fire\" :)\nGood Food Coop I started out with 2 contacts, given by Chris Brandt, an old school member. 1 of those 2 contacts gave 6 other names. Some are just maybes, it was a long time ago. I have addresses for 2 of them, and will send out letters this week inviting them to participate. Hopefully they will either have contact info for the others, prove to be helpful, or both.\nFrom my 5 minutes of Conversation with my one contact (Joel Handorff), it's looking really juicy and promising.  Apparently many of the founders of the GFC met via \"organizing\" - rent strikes, etc.. and that some of those members had known each other through political action in the 30s. If that's true, there's a lot of depth here.\nI still have to find the founders of the GHFC though.\nWhen I've contacted all of the actual GFC & GHFC founders I can.. I'll be in touch.\nI've started page on the wiki. Sorry if you can't access it because you don't have an account.. IT is working on having a training & signup day, so that we can better collaborate.. hopefully that will happen sooner than later. http://4thstreetfoodcoop.org/bin/wiki/foodcoop/view/Members/AdminCoopHistory\"\n",
