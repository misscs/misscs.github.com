    "title": "Creatively re:imagining our futures using on/offline participatory models and tools",
    "description": "This talk explores ways that we can re:organize and re:figure ourselves to create more adaptive, responsive, and inclusive societies. Drawing from fieldwork and experiments in Taiwan and NYC, as well as cybernetics, we propose that we can use participatory models to help re:imagine and re:shape society. We will look at the role both on and offline tools can facilitate to help us bring into practices new modes of being together on a present, future, speculative time continuum.\nThis talk is meant to spark a conversation. It is by no means a definite list of all the patterns, that can only be accomplished collectively.",
