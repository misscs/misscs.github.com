Humble CSS and expressive JavaScript have made their come back. The discipline of front end is undergoing massive change, a revolution so to speak, and it has nothing to do with NodeJS, Sass, or PostCss, even though we tout them among the myriad of reasons. For revolutions happen when we adopt new behaviors not new technologies.\nThis talk explores the events in the history of front-end web development that lead to the bouleversement within the field. It presents a framework for analyzing growth and adoption of tech tools using behavioral models. We‚Äôll explore the importance of our behavior shifts not only for developers and designers, but for the world outside of the web industry; especially when it comes to tackling our next challenges which are cannot be resolved with code\n",

Drawing from fieldwork and experiments in Taiwan and NYC, as well as cybernetics, we propose that we can use participatory models to help re:imagine and re:shape society. We will look at the role both on and offline tools can facilitate to help us bring into practices new modes of being together on a present, future, speculative time continuum.\nThis talk is meant to spark a conversation.

      "description": "Career Paths for Women in Tech\nFifty-six percent of women in technology companies leave their organizations at the mid-level point of their careers (10-20 years). Many leave because of the culture and lack of other women in leadership roles.\nWhen women don‚Äôt see other women in the higher echelons of tech, it takes away not only a tangible, visible goal toward which to aspire, but it also makes it much harder to find an empathetic mentor.\nSo, what career paths can we follow as women?\nThrough our topic, Careers Paths for Women in Tech, we will explore our own observations, experiences, obstacles and successes in the tech industry. Let's inspire women to aim high and stay in tech.\n",

Thank you all for your support and commitment to help us women move forward in our tech careers. Thank you for being great role models!",

Claudina's current project is autotax.com (powered by Sass of course). Outside of her day gig, she is also developing a startup residency program; driven by the burning question: how can we design and engineer more successful startups. Claudina is very involved in the Sass grass-roots community. In fact, I was introduced to Claudina via a common thread. We both organize and manage Sass Meetups, mine in Seattle and hers in NY. And because I assume that she isn't busy enough, between the startup residency program and the meetup, there is also enough room to start planning the first ever SassConf."
